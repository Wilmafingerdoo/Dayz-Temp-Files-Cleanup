# Dayz Temp Files Cleanup
I found that while playing DayZ i would have a message pop up saying low disk space when before i started playing i had 8GB plus and i would get down to 0 bytes during gamplay. i was clearing out programs to try and make space and came across this foler with alot of crash log files and dump files in, totaling 101 GB.

## *Batch files*
## *USE AT YOUR OWN RISK IM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU PUT IN THE INCORRECT PATH. IF YOU PUT A PATH INTO ONE OF THE FIRST 2 .BAT FILES AND RUN IT, IT WILL DELETE WHAT IS IN THAT FOLDER WITHOUT ASKING IF YOU ARE SURE YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*

## *READ EVERYTHING*

4 examples of a batch file you can run to quickly delete the files in the DayZ temp folder.

****************************************************************************************

## *All you need to do is pick one of the batch files*
- Open the bat file with a text editor (notepad/ notpad++/ vscode. ect ), 
- Then change the YOURUSERNAME to whatever the user folder is called on your computer. (i would navigate to the folder and copy the whole path just to be sure its correct.) 
- Save the file. 
- Go to where you just saved it and double click it.

Optionally you could set this up to run on an automated task weekly or whatever in windows if you wanted (i havent done this as id prefer to do it manually and to keep some logs incase i need to send off a crash log) theres plenty of videos online showing how to set up a scheduled task to run a program (.bat in this case).
